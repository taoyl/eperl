# eperl
A fork of embedded perl from Marginal Hacks.

(http://marginalhacks.com/Hacks/ePerl/)

This tool allows you to expand perl statements inside of text files. It was originally written in C by Ralf S. Engelschall. Marginal Hacks rewrote in Perl in a fraction of the space. The actual filter program is something like 80 lines, but adding compatibility and documentation puffed it up to 1400 or so - all in one script.

# Full and min version

There are two versions available, full and minimal.

The full version tries to remain as compatible to the C version of ePerl as possible. The minimal version is much smaller and more efficient, so if efficiency is more important than options, than go for the minimal version. (Amongst other things, the minimal version does *not* support CGI mode).
