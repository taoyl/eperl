# eperl
A fork of ePerl from Marginal Hacks (http://marginalhacks.com/Hacks/ePerl/)

This tool allows you to expand perl statements inside of text files. It was originally written in C by Ralf S. Engelschall. Marginal Hacks rewrote in Perl in a fraction of the space. The actual filter program is something like 80 lines, but adding compatibility and documentation puffed it up to 1400 or so - all in one script.
